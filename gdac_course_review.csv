"I finished this course, and I'd say that is a bit disappointment for me because I find it pretty entry level and simple, and also a lot of taking time and a lot of content pretty useless. It seems to me that they entire content could have been squeezed to one third of existing as introducery, and thereafter essential staff to br presented. Also little to no emphasize at building portfolio project and thus gaining experience as essential part of future employment. Definitlely I wouldn't recommend.",0

"I’ve had a little bit of a hard time getting a job as an operations/business analyst (I’ve had a few interviews and someone with more experience has been picked over me every time). The more I research, I realize I am very interested in the data analyst route. I have a degree in finance, use to work in fintech banking operations for 2&1/2 years and am currently self teaching myself SQL & Python, as I see this is required quite a bit. I just left the mortgage lending industry and currently work as a waitress (been there part time for 7 years). Financially I am fine, so i am ready to take a new route on certifying, wondering if this the missing piece for me to finally get hired or any other recommendations? Thank you for sharing.",0

"I finished the course in July, and after a 4-month job search, I have found that adding this Google certificate in Data Analytics is only helpful if you already have a bachelor’s degree in a related field, such as engineering, math, accounting, project management, IT, or business.  Even then, you still need some sort of connection with the company you’re applying for, an internship, or some experience.  
I have a masters degree in education and foreign languages, and I had connections with a large consulting company, but I didn’t even get an interview, even with recommendations, because I simply wasn’t qualified for a Data Analysis job. 
This course was a GREAT starter for anyone who has zero knowledge of data analysis and the programs used (SQL, Tableau, R) but it will take a significant amount of studying and getting credentials to be eligible for a job in this field. 
I have continued teaching part-time (because ALL my eggs are in that basket) while going to college specifically for Bioinformatics.
I hope this helps others make informed decisions about this program! 😊",1

"Currently taking the course (6 of 8 modules done), with very little previous knowledge and with ambition to switch careers to data analytics/data science in the long run. The program is broken up into small chunks to be easy for you to slice into daily segments which helped me certainly. It is a very brief introduction into the necessary concepts and tools therefore offering no real depth. In the SQL-segment I felt the more complex issue was actually missing a practice segment because, let's face it, if you don't write your own queries, things will seem opaque and arbitrary. (They point you to another free online SQL course during the program so I will do that once I go into project work). The most informed thing I feel I can say about the program is: you get everything shown once, along with some basic application. It's then up to you to really find your project work for your portfolio to show your future employer.
I was working full time in my day job taking a 1 hour+ per day on the program after work on four days of the week with a six week break for an important other business project. At current pace I expect to finish the 8th and last certificate in just under 8 months (break included; so it could be 6-7 months with no interrupts). I expect to be building my portfolio (and application) for another 5 months total after (doing one business dev project of my own choosing, one real life business pro bono, one data heavy data base thing with sports results and betting odds over a decade-long period and trying to put it into video form for YouTube so it's easy to follow the process I went through if an employer wants to dig deeper). 
So knowing what I know today, I'd suggest to completely switch fields to data analytics I plan about one year to do it. If you have spare time you may be done quicker.",1

I seriously doubt that this course would make you job ready. Its pretty basic. But the course structure is pretty good and lays a good foundation for you to begin with. Don't take more than a month to complete it. Else you would be wasting the time you could use to practice further.,0

"Data scientist here. These certs won't open any doors. Trust me, the market is beyond saturated. Everyone and there mother has this cert now. 10 years ago it may have meant something but now the data field has moved onto advanced ML and AI, and for that you'll need a MSC minimum either in stats or comp sci. 

Save your time and try to get into web dev or SWE instead. For everyone 1 DS position open there's like 10 SWE positions open. 

Also, if you're handling data at your current job like accounting, general operations, etc. That's extremely basic. Even advanced Excel is nothing, you can learn that in a month. You need proper, disciplined training with LOTs of math if and years of study if you want that 200-300k DS position now. I can't stress this enough. Don't waste your time unless you're willing to work for garbage pay for the next 5 years while learning difficult programming and mathematics.",1

Why will a university graduate take a certification course after acquiring a degree?,0
"I am currently taking the Google Data Analytics course. In my experience the first few parts of the course are pretty good, but as you continue further the course is severely lacking. Some things are rushed through and make you think that you have missed a few chapters. I have come to the conclusion that finishing this course will get me the certificate, but it will be necessary to take separate courses on SQL, Tableau and R to get the knowledge and skills for a confident start on a job. I'd also like to think that this is not because of my personal experience or learning strength, but that this will apply to most students.
So is it worth it? Yes and No. The certificate is an added bonus, but the course is not ""all you need"" to get the necessary skills to start a data analytics career.",0

"I have a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing and took a couple of analytics courses where I got my Google Analytics & Excel Expert certifications and used SPSS, SAS and JMP; however, I don’t have any work experience with these tools.

"Hi Luke, thanks for your content. It's really informative! I really like it! I work in marketing and I am thinking about upskilling myself in data analysis to help with my job in marketing. In particular, most of my job focuses on digital ads. Hence, I think it would be useful to upskill myself in data analysis. 
Having said that, digital marketing has other areas to specialise in such as PPC, SEO, email, etc. I don't think data analysis is the key driver in my work. 
Just wondering from your perspective, would you think that I should take this course or would you advise me to learn specific tools directly like SQL, Tableau, etc. to help with decision making and reporting in marketing?",0

"There are many videos talking about the need for a Master's degree versus professional certificates, but how about making one about Post Graduate courses that are usually shorter and more practical in nature? I`ve seen mixed reviews for example of the Simplilearn courses offered together with Purdue University. In some countries, a PG course specialization is considered at the same level as a Master's degree, but in other countries that option doesn't even exist and it's even difficult to translate the term and try to explain to the employer what a PG course is. How are those viewed in the market in several countries in general? (I live in Japan, and it's one of those countries that I'd need to explain what it is like)

Just some of my feedback as I am on Module 5 for the Data Analytics professional certificate. I currently just graduated with my BA in marketing and minored in applied computing. I believe what these courses is very similar conceptually. Starting Module 5 I am starting to work more on the technical assignments diving into SQL. As I find myself in the gruesome job hunt like many are after college and having multiple interviews. I do not know if this will be enough experience to land any kind of job. I relate this professional certificate closely to my applied computing minor. I guess we will see when i finished the courses.,0

"Loved the video my Dude 🍺🤜🤛🦋🙅

I have been looking in to data science and machine learning for couple years now .

Finally got my self together to begin the journey, of learning python and Data science with machine learning.

I have come to conclusions that I'll be using Coursera as my main source of education and certificates.

And for the project part I'll be using the kaggle as you mentioned in one of your videos that i watched earlier.

Just trying to put everything together so that i have the right steps for a baby to begin its journey in to the world of coding 🥰🤩🦋🙅

I'm definitely determined to succeed and get a good job in the future with the knowledge acquired.

Would love to do data science as my main job as i heard the salary there is very good around 100k a year, but then the machine learning as an side hustle to develop more advanced skills and to progress even further.
I know i commented on a video earlier on what courses I'll be taking, just would love for you to reach out to me and let me know if I'm going on the right track with my begging of learning all of this. ❤️

Thanks mate.
Have an awesome day brother.

I'm sure industry recruiters are aware of this and I'd say it's a very good idea to still get a degree, either that or grind out projects.

This would possibly give Google more control over their employees, who would have no choice but to accept a larger workload for lower pay.
They might not be able to readily find work with any company outside this group with this type of qualification.
After investing all that time and money, will they might be more willing to go along with whatever they are told to do.

A lot of people apply to big companies like Google, surely they would be have access to people with these skills?

It's following a course that's not even sponsored by google themselves (as in, credited by them) but a third party and paying $1,000 for these type of courses when you could very-well get the same thing at a college for less or just get the certification.

"Beloved, Please give this your special attention. 

God is a Good, Holy and Just( meaning that He up holds justice and does what He deems as good) Judge. He is also forgiving and He is All-Loving. He is also perfect meaning that there is nothing about Him this is  contradictory. But How can He forgive you and me but still uphold Justice. 

Look at it in this way:  Judges who punish the innocent and release the wicked  and quilty, are wicked, evil and are corrupt. It does not matter how much a quilty man is sorry for his crime, he must go to jail. Let's say a man raped and murdered a little girl, but is so sorry for the rape; the judge must still send him to jail. And likewise God must still punish our sins, but He can still forgive us. How? How can God forgive us and still satisfy His Justice? 

This is how:  

All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. There is none righteous, no not one” (Romans 3:10, 23 NKJV).
-It means that each and every single person sins and has sinned. 

“The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord” (Romans 6:23).
-Death is eternal separation from God in hell.
- But believing in Christ alone allows you to be with God in everlasting joy. 
 
•""The iniquity and sins of each and every persons were placed upon Jesus Christ who was sinless. 

•Jesus Christ, the Son of God was crucified for our sins. 

 •Jesus Christ was buried and our sins were buried with Him to live no more.

•Jesus Christ arose from the dead on the third day and all who believe and receive Him as Lord arose to new life with Him.

• New life in Jesus Christ is received through faith in His death burial and resurrection, when the person repents of their sin and asks Jesus Christ to forgive their sin and wash their heart.

Beloved seek Him, read the Bible, not the catholic Bible(deutero-canonical books)

Start by read the whole of the new testament, starting from Matthew to Revelation..

"Hi Luke, thank you for the video. I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.

As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.

I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree. 

When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.

My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.

None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.

Again, thanks for the video, this is the first of yours I've watched, going to check out some of your others.",4
"On your Recommendation I saw Alex the analyst video as well. However, your video was way better because you were truly honest about your opinion regarding this certificate course. So please stick to that and do not change. Thank you",0

"Hey Luke, just found your channel. You're making good content. Keep up. I am facing sort of a confusion and maybe you can help. I've been in digital marketing for the last 2 years and use web and search Analytics tools quite often. I am quite decent at data studio and spreadsheets as well. I also learnt bit of python, R and Tableau some time ago through online courses and did a few small projects but I don't feel confident at them, mainly because of a lack of practice. Btw my company doesn't use SQL and it's completely alien to me. 

I want to use my experience in marketing to grow as a data professional. I had been eagerly waiting for this course since google announced it last year. But now I feel it won't be very helpful to me. Do you think I should take this course to further my career? If not, what would you suggest I should learn and do to move to the next level?",4

Question 🙋‍♂️ I’m have absolutely no knowledge on It but am interested in it and I’m currently not able to go to college because of personal reasons is  this a good option and are there any others,0
"The thing is that re-skilling will be a continuous process over time since technology is growing faster every day. You can’t simply afford a bachelor or master degree every 5-10 years. I got one BSc and one Master degree and the amount of money that you spend doesn’t worth the real knowledge I got from them. 

Massive online courses and certifications with low-entry price should be the future for a continuous education for emoloyees.

The business model for education should change and adapt to the reality of the market.",0

I just graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering but lately I have been liking data engineer as a career. In my degree we did not learn a lot about coding, so would you recommend this course for me? Thank you",1
"Hi! I watched this video after completing Course 3 out of this Certification program. I agree with most of the points Luke spoke up. It's definitely for entry-level people and I would better polish my python skills instead of learning R. Spreadsheets used in this course is Google Sheets, data base - BigQuery, all Google products. What I don't agree is about the speed. Is actually great for beginners! Luke is a pro, so he doesn't really need this course, but for me it's great speed. I don't feel overwhelmed or demotivated.",12
"OK, outside of USA, from Europe, and quick question: where on this website there is any direct link to total cost of all those courses or something? I mean, yeah I'm interested but after a long day at work I simply want to find such info quickly and truth to be told it's shiny package , attractive to people with degrees in data and such but seriously cannot info about pricing/ cost/ payment methods accepted be put out somewhere in a place easier to to be found than now? I mean, I would expect to be busy with the content of such course , not with figuring out how much, when, in what currency and to what account shall I pay for it.",0

"As a data practitioner Google, aws, and some other trainings are still falling short purposely on teaching you the core of data management and data structuring. I have not heard of a course by any these platforms that does teach data structuring specifically. Unfortunately, you will still need to have traditional/formal teaching ( can be a dedicated coursera course taught by a professor or multi-industry professionals ) to get a good baseline in this. I wouldn't encourage getting a Google cert, aws cert, or azure cert by itself but rather work with a university to get a professional certificate and get the above certs mentioned after that.",1

Voice was suppose to be integrated into Hangouts, then no to keep them separate, now removing Voice from Hangouts.  You get a Coursera Cert not a GOOGLE cert.  Google licensed their brand.

"This is bogus.  No employer, with the possible exception of google, will hire you for that position without a degree period.  When they announced the course was ready I looked into it.  First I spent a few days just trying to find advertisements for data analysts.  They don't advertise those positions in the usual places but eventually I found them.  I contacted 12 random employers and asked if they would hire someone who did not have a degree but had this certificate for an entry level data analytics position.  The answer from all 12 was a flat and resounding ""NO!""   I did not contact google or coursera to ask them due to the fact that neither has a physical presence in my state.  This is just coursera trying to get people to sign up for their web site so they can make money.  In a few months, however long it takes for people to complete this, there are going to be a lot of very disappointed certificate holders who don't have a degree or a job.",1

Is it possible to move to Data Science after working as Data Analyst for few years ?
Actually I am making longer term goals.",4

"Great video, it was very informative, thanks! I applied for financial aid since I'm a college student. Hopefully the application is accepted and I can take the course for free. On another note, I feel like companies saying that they accept certificates in place of a college degree is a bit disingenuous. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I feel like unless you're a prodigy with some amazing side projects, companies won't bat an eye if you don't have some college degree. I highly doubt major corporations will take person A who has a Google Analytics certificate over person B who has a CS degree from a university - assuming all other variables are the same. Just my two cents...",3

"My take on is this. There are exceptional people who can learn anything at a professional level. Computer science, engineering, math, architecture, you name it. These are the kind of people who can take these courses and be hired into a company a be a great asset for their team. However, there are other ""normal"" people who don't have that amazing intellect to learn everything. I am a software engineer, degree and all of that. I have 3 coworkers that took a certificate on the technology (crm tool) we  work with. They are math, history and law majors. They excel at working with the tool and delivering simple stories but whenever they encountered something related with service integration, code complexity, asynchronous problems or even simple SQL etc they require a lot of help. This sometimes causes other members to assign bandwidth to help them out there. College REALLY does train you to be a problem solver. IF you ever want to take a certification and work for a software company please make sure you don't become a liability to your team. Study the basics!",2

I'm taking the certificate because employers don't take me seriously despite the fact that I have nearly 10 years of database development and metrics design (graduated in Humanities).  Sometimes it's just about resume padding.  And because I know most of the material already the courses are going by really, really fast.",0

"They’re not approving certs over degrees because anyone with a STEM degree will always outclass a single certification. These certifications tend to have online test banks posted by previous test takers. Perhaps at some point certs will evolve to a higher difficulty, be more difficult to cheat from, and a set of certs can be equivalent to a degree. But at this point, a certification will not add much value to a STEM degree. If you’ve got no other avenues and can’t prove your worth through projects or freelancing, get the cert.",0

"I’m halfway through Course 4, and I’ve enjoyed it so far. I have a technical background (more hardware level, think A+ Certification). Some takeaways I have on this course is that the videos are a little dry, but select videos have a question or two that pop up through the video or at the end that pertains to the video content. I will say that it does seem like a very high-level overview of everything. I have learned a ton so far and will continue to finish the program. I have started looking at other courses on Udemy and YouTube to supplement my knowledge, especially since Courses 6-8 aren’t available yet (Tableau, R, and the Capstone Project).",37
"I think that you could still land a role even without this certification provided that you have many years of experience working, in general, to back it up. I wouldn't imagine they'd hire a high school kid with just this but someone who has a very diverse background to demonstrate that they are capable of learning more and very quickly.",41

"I ve been using Excel, quite good at it, did a bit of R(market segmentation and clustering, and I have a decent knowledge of stats) and studied SQL on my own( joins, views, triggers). With that being said, I'm quite disappointed in this course. 

First, SQL. They list a source of materials, which are free anyway, and therefore zero input from google. 
I also find it kind of unacceptable to start off SQL with a query, and not going first through the concepts of relations, keys or constraints. If I m given a list of free external sources(which are not enough, and aren't google materials, so they spent zero $ and zero time on them), what's the point of paying google? They spent so much time talking about how important data is, that I expected a similar approach with the rest of the topics. 
Second, tableau; same approach, zero guidance, zero input from google, just some free stuff I could have found myself. 
Hoping their assignments are worth the time and money. 

Not even sure the course is worth it, unless one is a pure beginner. With a little bit of exposure into this field, I m afraid it would actually hurt me, as I would be pictured as a pure beginner when I m not. Am I missing something?",0

"I can't speak on this google cert, but I have completed the Google IT Support along with A+ and Net+. I loved the Google over the A+ stuff as there is so much more hands-on and more engaging material. I believe the Google IT would carry a lot more weight if the course had a proctored final exam. To be honest, If I was a hiring manager I would take the person who completed the Google IT cert over a person who took the A+. Hands-on is better than power memorising any day of the week. As for as time, they suggest 6 months, I did it in 10 weeks as I was taking my A+ material. Fingers crossed they come out with some more of these Certs as they would be very beneficial as people re-skill post covid.",333
